# tibetaneditor

This PyQt5 project is a beta version of readability editor for the Tibetan language.

The readability editor assesses the readability of a text by highlighting words according to their level of difficulty. Levels of frequency are defined by analysing the frequency of words in a given language.

The beta version allows users to:

1. write or paste text in the editor
2. segment and highlight the text by clicking on the segment icon

To test the tool, paste the text from test_source.txt in the editor and click the segmentation icon. The result should look like this:

Features comming soon:
- spell-checking
- rules and vocab list editing for segmentation/POS tagging/spell-checking
- suggestion of spelling correction
- suggestion of vocabulary alternative

    * Details:
        - RDRPOSTagger4Local.py works even with current install of RDR (modified paths)
        - create an entry point to RDR that does not care about paths (it is the copy of what I had for my clean install of RDR)
        - adds mechanism to choose what language and what model to use
        - ensures to only initialize the tagger when WordManager is instanciated or when we change model
        - adds mechanism to add tags directly to words (list of Word objects), but also includes a classic mode (the one used now)
        - filters which Word obj should be tagged and keeps an index to reinsert tags in the corresponding obj
        - implements better RDR models for Tibetan
        - improves pytib results by removing unnecessary lexical resources
        - solves bug of disapearing punctuation (obj.content = \n + punctation)
        - solves once and for all the problem of / in the original string by internally using a rune unicode character as separator. (the users still see /)
        - prepares pytib for coming new post-tagging processing of words
        - segmentation and re-segmentation works
        - include two files (try_pytib.py, try-new-RDR-api.py) to test the new features
        - added spaces around non-tib punctuation is solved
        - revert _ to spaces before displaying in the editor.
